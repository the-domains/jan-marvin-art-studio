  Put some bling into your life! This Jan Marvin ‘Art of Joy’ lined canvas
  yellow striped tote bag with a shiny gold sea turtle is fashionable as well as
  practical. The blue circle has been carefully hand-painted onto the bag and
  then the gold was applied. The gold is soft, not stiff. The bag is lightweight
  yet sturdy enough to use as a beach bag, weekender, travel carry-on, lunch
  bag, to hold books, items for your hobby, and much more!
